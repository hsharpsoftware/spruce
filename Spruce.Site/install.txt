Checklist:

- Create an App pool that runs with .NET 4
- Make sure the Site has authentication set to Windows and anonymous is disabled (can this be done in the web.config?)
- Other troubleshooting here about separate server deployment

For making it a little easier to edit views in the MSAgile project, without having to copy the View folder
each time, run this command in a console inside the Site directory:

mklink /d Template ..\Spruce.Templates.MSAgile\Views

NOTE: Mercurial sees this as an actual directory, so delete the link before any commits.
