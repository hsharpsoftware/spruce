Spruce is an ASP.NET MVC 3 frontend for managing work items in Team Foundation Server 2010. It is influenced by Bitbucket, Fogbugz and other simple to use bug tracking systems.

## Features:

* Web based, simple UI
* Powerful search
* Stored queries support
* Filtering, sorting, paging of work items
* Extensible plugin system for new TFS project types
* RSS and Excel exports
* View, add and edit attachments
* Full history of each work item
* Markdown support for descriptions

By default Spruce comes with a plugin for the MS Agile project template. This works with with Bug and Task work item types, which also work with the CMMI project type. Future versions may have full support for all work item types, as well as CMMI and Scrum TFS project types.
